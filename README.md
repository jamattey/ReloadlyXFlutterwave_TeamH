# Glossary

## Acronym	Expand	Definition
SWM	Solid Waste Management	This refers to any paradigm that deals with waste that exists in solid form.
MSW	Municipal Solid Waste	This is a waste type consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public. It is sometimes regarded as rubbish, trash, garbage
SWMC	Solid Waste Management Company(s)	A private or public company or group of companies responsible for collecting, treating, and disposing of solid material that is discarded because it has served its purpose or is no longer useful.
	Waste Footprint	Borrowed from the definition of carbon footprint, the waste footprint is the amount of solid waste generated as a result of the activities of a particular individual, organization, or community.
WAU	Weekly Active Users	A weekly active user is someone who interacts with an app over a period of seven days
WoW	Week on Week	This form of analysis means comparing user data from one week to the previous week.
MoM	Month on Month	This form of analysis means comparing user data from one week to the previous week.
NPR	Net Promoter Score	Net Promoter Score is a metric that gauges customer loyalty and satisfaction simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend your product or service on a simple scale.
CAC	Customer Acquisition Cost	This refers to the resources and costs incurred to acquire an additional customer.

# Objective
•	To create a platform that fosters communal participation in waste management by rewarding users for sorting and segregating waste products.
•	This pre-sorting and segregation reduce costs by nearly 45%, making it easier for Falley to recycle products faster and reduce overflowing waste bins.
•	Falley originates from the idea of communal effort towards sanitation issues. It is very common to see the community gather to clean the streets, desilting gutters, and weeding. The Ga-Adangbe ethnic group in Ghana calls this process fale-fale and we hope to use this product to revive communal participation towards waste management.

# Market Research
In Ghana, each person generates 0.0005 tonnes of waste daily. This translates into about 900,000 metric tons of waste per year at a population of 2.3m in 2010 (CCAC, Accra MSW Factsheet, 2010)
Now, more than a decade later and these numbers are expected to increase. This effectively throws the traditional waste management lifecycle into disarray as generation rates overshadow current waste collection and management policies and arrangements. 
As a result, it is very common to find overflowing dustbins in market centers, solid waste in gutters, and even in water bodies. The longer waste is left uncollected, the increased threat it poses to the environment and health conditions of citizens. 
Unsafe drinking water contributed to 72% of diarrheal deaths, while unsafe sanitation contributed to about 56% of deaths from diarrheal diseases.
We want to find an alternative to the current waste management lifecycle. We believe that, until the community is actively involved in the waste management lifecycle, there will always be an imbalance. People will always consume products (products are made to be consumed), but the end products of this can be put to good use (recycling) and prevented from picking up space in landfills. 
Also, we want to create a touchpoint between SWMCs and their clients as we believe this is one area that lacks customer service of any form. As a result, most people see waste management as the sole responsibility of SWMCs in charge, rather than a shared responsibility. 
Finally, the absence or lack thereof with regard to credible sources of data relating to waste footprints makes its management an economically unviable venture. The increased operational costs of SWM companies cost for WMCs has huge effects on our efforts to win the sanitation battle.
All these factors and market indicators call for a product that can
1.	Reward community involvement in waste management
2.	Provide data for waste collection and composition
3.	Use GIS to improve waste pickup efficiency and reduce operational costs.

# Competitive Analysis
Sesa Gh is a waste management company offering innovative recycling services for businesses, corporations, and households in Ghana. Similar to us, they offer rewards for the sorting and segregation of waste. They also encourage users to either drop off at predestined locations or request a pickup.

We differentiate ourselves from the direction and the strategy of our product. Unlike them, our product is more focused on community involvement and creating a relationship with our users, using our products as touchpoints.

Rewards are incentives for community involvement in our quest to reduce waste treatment costs and part of our marketing strategy, but we want to make it a collective effort rather than portray a traditional cash-for-trash system.
Success metrics
Goal	Metrics
Increase the WAU	5% increase in WAU WoW for the last quater of the year. This is our north star metric
Increase Customer Loyalty	Maintain a positive NPS. This is an indicator that we have more promoters than passives. Passives can help us find flaws or product shortcomings, whilst promoters can provide a richflow of users through referrals.
Customer Acquisition Cost	Three months after our launch, we hope to reduce our CAC by 5% each month to save up marketing revenues for future campaigns

# Messaging & positioning

## Product description
Falley is a mobile application for individuals looking for a reliable way to keep their waste pilling up whilst getting rewarded for their effort to separate their trash.
Short positioning statement

We help clean-conscious individuals who have a problem collecting and disposing of their waste empty their dustbins quicker and avoid the discomfort and health risks of overflowing bins.

## Detailed positioning statement

For customers who love to maintain clean surroundings, we help them to avoid the discomforts of filthy and smelly bins and encourage an attitude of waste separation, and reward them in doing so.

Unlike other trash-to-cash programs, our pickups are prompt, relegating the discomfort of overflowing bins to a thing of history.
Top-Line message	Prompt waste pickups, no bin full ups	Waste collection should not have to be your expense	Play your part to end
global warming

## Product promise	
Your trash pick ups, 1 week or less.	We will remove your trash bills from your debit and add it to your credit	Find satisfaction
knowing that your waste products do not end up in a landfill

Customer pain points	Life becomes very uncomfortable when waste
bins fill and overflow and become a natural habitat for germs and flies. Add rain to the story, and this becomes a stinking proposition.	ndividuals pay high fees to keep their bins from filling up	A lot of users might result to burning waste or improper disposal which has climate and
environmental disadvantages.

Product proof points	Our request feature provides a prompt to help our collectors pickup your trash in 72hrs or less.	Our reward system calculates and payout
respective rewards based on your commitment to waste separation.	The pickup feature means that your waste is now in our warehouse undergoing recycling
Pricing

This product will be offered free of charge to the users. This is to motivate more users to join. This increase in number increases the amount of value we can generate from waste goods. This makes the product the subsidy side of our network, with our recycling business, the money side.


An increase in the number of users will lead to an increase in the number of waste materials submitted. This increases the raw material base for our recycled products which can be sold to offset the free product.

The reward system is also a cost deference mechanism. Under normal circumstances, unsorted waste will have to go through a complex sorting process before treatment.

Rewarding users will cut our sorting costs by nearly 50%. We also reduce the amount of time spent on sorting, which has variable cost factors such as manpower and electricity.

# Future roadmap
These are the following features we look to release in the near future

•	A routing feature
We want a routing feature that directs our pickup vans to the places where they need to be. We see a foreseeable future where we can integrate self-driving vehicles to aid in the pickup and such a feature would provide a rich dataset to train that data for these vehicles. Routing also allows us to diversify our collection strategies and mechanics (ie. knowing when to use bikes against pickup trucks, to provide accessibility to remote slums)

•	A referral system
Birds of the same feather flock together. To promote a community-centric approach to waste management, we will allow current users to invite new users to earn credits in the form of airtime or gift cards. 

•	Corporate Pickups feature sets
Big manufacturing firms are growing and generating a lot of waste in the process. Pickup features that allow corporations to effectively dispose of their solid waste is a possibility we see for the future. These corporate partnerships can form part of their CSR and also help them reduce their carbon footprints or use biodegradable raw materials (which we produce from our recycling plants). 

•	A digitally printed waste footprint
The data points collected from users about the variety of waste help us to create a waste profile for a particular user. These profiles can be combined with other waste profiles nearby to create a waste footprint of a particular area.  

•	Neighborhood “wars”
Users can compete with other users within their neighborhoods to see who gathers more points. This gamification feature ignites the competitive nature in humans through cognitive psychology to compete for various prizes and honors. This feature is purposely a marketing one to keep users committed to changes of their environment. 
•	USSD Feature
Whilst we are building an app for the next generation, we have to be aware of the current generation who are not too tech-savvy. Due to an existing familiarity with USSD apps used especially in banking and money transfers, it will be easier to implement a USSD experience for our platform to take the waste management experience offline.
